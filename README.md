# Pool App
Summer project for an app (currently intended for android only) that helps with balancing the chemical balance of pools based off of their current chem readings.


# Goals
<ol>
  <li>Have user input a pool's PH, chlorine, alkalinity, calcium hardness, and other readings.</li>
  <li>Implement the taylor watergram wheel (the logic used behind it) for pool diagnostics.</li>
  <li>Implement the charts in the back of the talor book.</li>
  <li>Implement a tool that estimates the volume of a pool based on its shape.</li>
  <li>Create pool profiles of different customers (this would track the history of a pool's chemistry over time and would also track the treatments performed towards the pool).</li>
  <li>Create different types of user profiles (owner of pool: only tracks the history of a single pool; pool technition: tracks history of any number of pools.

# General Notes for Pools
<ul>
  <li> If high amounts of hardness and alkalinity are combined, high concentrations of calcium carbonate may result in scale formation or cloudy water.</li>
  <li> When cal hypo is added to a pool, pH, alkalinity and hardness of treated water may drift upward.</li>
  <li> A Saturation Index (SI) between -0.5 to 0.5 is considered balanced. Use the Taylor watergram wheel to calculate the SI of a pool based off of its current chemical balance. If a pool's SI is outside of the range, adjust the wheel's readings (PH, ALK, CALCIUM, TEMP) in ways that make sense (don't set temp to 50, or PH to 6, or any crazy shit; remember calcium hardness can only be reduced by draining a pool and refiniling it) until the pool falls into the range of a balanced SI. Use the found adjustments to determine<li>
